# Schedule Restrictions Implementation Summary

## âœ… **COMPLETED CHANGES**

### **Backend Changes (backend/app/crud.py)**

1. **Sunday Restriction**:

   - Modified `get_available_slots()` and `get_available_slots_with_classes()` functions
   - Added check: `if date.weekday() == 6: return []` (Sunday = weekday 6)
   - No time slots are generated for Sunday

2. **Saturday Limited Hours**:
   - Modified business hours logic to check weekday
   - Saturday: 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM (`hour=13`)
   - Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM (`hour=21`)

### **Frontend Changes (frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js)**

1. **Calendar Filter**:

   - Modified `getWeekDays()` function to filter out Sundays
   - Added: `.filter(day => day.getDay() !== 0)` (Sunday = day 0)
   - Sunday no longer appears in the date selection calendar

2. **Operating Hours Notice**:
   - Added blue info box with operating hours
   - Text: "Segunda a Sexta: 9h Ã s 21h | SÃ¡bado: 9h Ã s 13h | Domingo: Fechado"

## ðŸ“… **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **For Users:**

1. **Date Selection Calendar**:

   - Only shows Monday through Saturday
   - Sunday is completely hidden from selection

2. **Time Slots**:

   - **Monday-Friday**: Available slots from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM (last slot ends at 9:00 PM)
   - **Saturday**: Available slots from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM (last slot ends at 1:00 PM)
   - **Sunday**: No date selection available, no time slots

3. **Visual Indication**:
   - Operating hours are clearly displayed at the top of the booking page
   - Users understand the schedule restrictions before selecting dates

### **For Admins:**

1. **Class Scheduling**:

   - Same restrictions apply to admin class scheduling
   - Cannot schedule classes on Sunday
   - Saturday classes must end by 1:00 PM

2. **Booking Management**:
   - Existing functionality maintained
   - Schedule restrictions enforced at API level

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING VERIFICATION**

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Frontend Test**:

   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Login and navigate to booking page
   - Verify Sunday is not in the date selector
   - Select Saturday and verify time slots only go until 12:00 PM
   - Select any weekday and verify normal hours (9 AM - 8 PM)

2. **Backend Test**:
   - API calls to `/bookings/available-slots` for Sunday should return empty array
   - API calls for Saturday should only return slots before 1:00 PM
   - API calls for weekdays should return normal business hours

## ðŸ“‹ **FILES MODIFIED**

- `backend/app/crud.py` - Time slot generation logic
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` - Calendar display and operating hours notice

## ðŸš€ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

âœ… **COMPLETE** - Sunday booking prevention  
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Saturday 1 PM closure  
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Frontend calendar filtering  
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Operating hours display  
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Backend API restrictions

The drum school scheduling system now properly enforces:

- **Closed on Sundays** (no bookings possible)
- **Saturday closes at 1 PM** (limited booking hours)
- **Normal weekday hours** Monday-Friday 9 AM to 9 PM
